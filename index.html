    <h2>üìä Egg Price Trends</h2>
    <p>Egg prices have surged over the past year. The chart below illustrates the increase in average retail prices.</p>

    <h2>üîç What's Causing the Spike?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Avian Influenza:</strong> Millions of birds were culled due to outbreaks, reducing supply.</li>
      <li><strong>Fragile Infrastructure:</strong> Many places with insufficient and unsustainable infrastructure were unprepared for Avian Influenza causing losses to be magnified</li>
      <li><strong>Rising Feed & Fuel Costs:</strong> Higher input costs are passed to consumers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üëõ What It Means for You</h2>
    <p>Rising egg prices affect food affordability, especially for low-income families. Eggs are a key ingredient in many diets, making price hikes widely felt.</p>
    <p>You can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Buy from local farms or co-ops</li>
      <li>Reduce waste by using all parts of the egg or freezing extras</li>
      <li>Buy sustainably sourced eggs, and support legislation that enforces more sustainable practices</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Misleading Labels </h2>
    <p>In the US, you may find labels such as <strong>Cage-free</strong>,
       <strong>Free-range</strong>, or <strong>Pasture-raised</strong> on your egg cartons.
      However, the names of these labels can misrepresent what the regulations for having 
      these labels are. It is important to be informed of this as a consumer, as many are
      misled to believe they are supporting sustainably produced eggs.
    </p>
    <p>Different Labels:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cage-free:</strong> This label is regulated by the USDA, but those regulations
      only require that they are not in a cage, and they can freely roam in an enclosed area with food and water. The regulations
    don't require that the hens be allowed outside, or specify how big the enclosure must be.</li>
      <li><strong>Free-range:</strong> Another label regulated by the USDA, the regulations only say
      that the hens must have a way to access the outdoors. The outdoor space could be a relatively small, fenced area, and
    the times at which the hens can access it is purely up to the farmer's will.</li>
      <li><strong>Pasture-raised:</strong> This label is not regulated by the USDA, so it is important that it
      is also accompanies by a stamp that says <strong>Certified Humane</strong> or <strong>Animal Welfare Approved</strong>. If
     it does meet these conditions, then it gaurentees that hens have at least 108 square feet 
    of outdoor space, and an equivalent amount of indoor space. If you want to consider supporting
  sustainable practices, look for this label and accompanying stamp when buying eggs!</li>
    </ul>
